# JWDFinal-Project

The purpose of the project was to establish the ability to work together to construct a working website that could offer the ability to create a todo list for ourselves or potential clients. 

Todo List functions:
- Add tasks by the add task button.
- Edit tasks by the edit task button.
- Delete tasks cards by delete button.
- When editing tasks, tasks can switch to a new column based on changed status. 


First we established our draft for the project **TASK 1** through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/GzxCKHSbgq1G7h2iMkS2s2/Wireframe)

**TASK 2** and **TASK 3** were to create the CSS and HTML design layout to the page by Bootstrap.

**TASK 4** to   **TASK 10** were the implementation of code for the functionality and method design of the page.
